## 1. Introduction
Thank you for using **Minimalista**! This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our app. Rest assured, **Minimalista** is a completely client-side application, meaning no data is collected, stored, or shared with anyone, including the developer.

- **Data Usage Permission**: To display your phone’s usage statistics (e.g., screen time).

These permissions are used solely for the app’s functionality, and no data accessed through these permissions is collected or shared.

## 4. Security
Since **Minimalista** is entirely client-side, your data remains on your device and is not transmitted elsewhere. We take your privacy seriously and ensure that no personal information is accessed or stored.
